He scammed me, and at least 5 other dudes i know of from ammounts ranging from as low as 40 to 100+ USD.

INFO:
-He is from Thailand
-His english is sub zero, he uses google translate
-All he knows is "lmao"
-He cant code shit, hes copy pasting othere peoples sources claiming its his
-Dumbass people like me fall for his shit
-He deserves to be fucked through legal action, serve jailtime
-his DC is full of bots, and fake vouches.
-When he is defending himself he keeps bringing up all his "repositories and deploys OMG"
-Even tho u show proof he scammed, he keeps saying no, that is fake proof and your account is new.
-Theres a reason he disabled "Issues" on his repositories, so noone can talk to him after he scams.
-He sometimes refuses to give out the discord as hes pissing hes pants.
-A huge red sign could be that he is giving "lifetime" cheats claiming they are "custom built, and undetected" for cheap prices.
-He cant even spell out "External" properly, and you expect him to be a proper coder lol

I already took steps to take him off including emails to discord for selling cheats through There which is a violation of discords TOS.
